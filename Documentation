#  GitHub Short Course Summary

Welcome! This file summarizes what I have learned from the GitHub short course. It covers the basics of version control, Git, and how to use GitHub for collaborating and managing code.

---

##  1. Introduction to Git and GitHub

Git is a version control system that tracks changes in source code. GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories and makes collaboration easier through features like pull requests and issues.

---

##  2. Git Basics

###  Initializing a Repository
- `git init` creates a new local Git repository.

###  Checking Status
- `git status` shows the state of your working directory and staging area.

###  Adding Files
- `git add <filename>` stages changes.
- `git add .` stages all changes.

###  Committing Changes
- `git commit -m "Your commit message"` records the changes in the repo history.

---

##  3. Working with GitHub

###  Creating a Repository
- You can create a new repository on GitHub using the website or the CLI.

###  Cloning a Repository
- `git clone <repo-url>` copies a remote repository to your local machine.

###  Pushing Changes
- `git push` uploads your commits to GitHub.

###  Pulling Changes
- `git pull` fetches and merges updates from the remote repo.

---

##  4. Collaboration and Pull Requests

###  Forking and Cloning
- Fork a repository to make your own copy.
- Clone your fork to your computer to work locally.

###  Creating a Pull Request
- Push your changes to a new branch and open a PR on GitHub to request a merge.

###  Code Reviews
- Collaborators can leave comments and approve PRs for merging.

---

##  5. Branching

- `git branch <branch-name>` creates a new branch.
- `git checkout <branch-name>` switches to it.
- This helps manage new features or experiments without affecting the main codebase.

---


##  7. Writing Good Commit Messages

Good commit messages are:
- Clear and concise.
- Describe *what* and *why*, not *how*.
- E.g., `Add user authentication using JWT`.

##  Conclusion

This short course has given me a solid foundation in using Git and GitHub. I can now track my code, collaborate with others, and contribute to open-source projects confidently.
